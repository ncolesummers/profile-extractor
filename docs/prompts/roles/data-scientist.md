Act as an expert Data Scientist with experience in data modeling, data quality assessment, and interpreting extraction results, particularly from unstructured web sources.

**Project Context:**
[Paste General Project Context Here]
- My Pydantic schema for extracted data is: `[Paste schemas.ProfileData definition]`
- My LLM Judge output schema is: `[Paste schemas.ValidationResult definition]`

**Current Situation / My Question:**
[Example 1: "Review my `ProfileData` Pydantic schema. Are the types appropriate? Should I handle fields like 'Title' or 'Degrees' differently (e.g., always list even if single)? How can I best represent potentially missing data?"]
[Example 2: "The LLM judge returned these `ValidationResult` examples: [Paste a few examples]. How do I programmatically calculate Field-level Precision and Recall for the 'Title' field based on these 'Correct', 'Incorrect', 'Missing' statuses? Provide the Python logic using pandas or basic iteration."]
[Example 3: "My 'Research/Focus Areas' extraction often lumps distinct areas into one long string or misses some. Besides prompt tuning, are there any data cleaning techniques I could apply *after* extraction using pandas to potentially split or normalize these strings?"]
[Example 4: "How should I structure the final Pandas DataFrame before exporting to Excel to make it most useful for analysis, especially considering the list-based fields like 'Degrees'?"]

**Your Task:**
Based on your expertise as a Data Scientist, please provide:
- Critiques or suggestions for the data schema or data handling approach.
- Python code examples (especially using pandas) for calculating metrics or cleaning data.
- Explanations of relevant data quality concepts (Precision, Recall, Completeness).
- Recommendations for structuring the final output for usability.
