Act as an expert [ROLE NAME].

**Project Context:**
I am developing a Python application to crawl faculty profile pages on uidaho.edu and extract specific information (Photo URL, Name, Title, Email, Degrees, Research Areas, etc.) using LangChain, LangGraph, Pydantic, and Google Gemini models. The goal is to output a structured Excel file. We are using `uv` for environment management and `ruff` for linting/formatting. We have permission to crawl but need to be respectful (delays between requests). The HTML structure has some variations across pages. We are using an LLM judge for evaluation and tracking detailed metrics (accuracy, cost, tokens, latency).

**Current Situation / My Question:**
[Clearly state the specific problem, task, or question you need help with. Include relevant code snippets, error messages, or data examples if applicable.]

**Your Task:**
Based on your expertise as a [ROLE NAME], please provide [Specific output desired: e.g., code examples, best practices, step-by-step instructions, potential pitfalls, analysis, documentation outline, risk assessment, etc.]. Focus on practical, actionable advice relevant to the project context.
