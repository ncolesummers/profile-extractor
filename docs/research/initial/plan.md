**Project Overview & Risk Management**

1.  **Key Risks & Mitigations:**
    *   Website Structure Changes
        - Risk: HTML structure variations across pages or future changes
        - Mitigation: Implement robust preprocessing with multiple fallback strategies
        - Monitor: Track extraction success rates by page template/pattern

    *   LLM Performance & Costs
        - Risk: High API costs or inconsistent extraction quality
        - Mitigation: Use Gemini 2.0 Flash for cost efficiency, implement caching
        - Monitor: Track token usage, costs, and accuracy metrics per field

    *   Rate Limiting & Respectful Crawling
        - Risk: Getting blocked or overwhelming the server
        - Mitigation: Implement configurable delays, exponential backoff
        - Monitor: Track request success rates and timing

2.  **Success Criteria:**
    *   Technical:
        - 95%+ extraction accuracy for critical fields (name, title, email)
        - < 1% rate limit errors
        - Processing time < 30 seconds per profile
        - API costs within budget (tracked via token counts)

    *   Quality:
        - Consistent formatting across extracted data
        - No duplicate entries
        - Complete coverage of all faculty profiles
        - Valid data types (URLs, emails, etc.)

3.  **Development Priorities:**
    *   Phase 1: Core Pipeline (Week 1)
        - Basic scraping and extraction working
        - End-to-end flow with sample data
        - Initial error handling

    *   Phase 2: Quality & Efficiency (Week 2)
        - Improve extraction accuracy
        - Optimize token usage
        - Add comprehensive metrics

    *   Phase 3: Production Readiness (Week 3)
        - Full dataset processing
        - Performance optimization
        - Documentation and monitoring
